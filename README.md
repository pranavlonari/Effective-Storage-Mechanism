# Huffman Algorithm File Compression

This project implements file compression using the Huffman algorithm. The compression tool is designed with several key features, divided into four modules.

## Modules:

### 1. Compress a File or Folder
This module enables the compression of a single file or an entire folder. The compressed file will be given an extension predetermined during development. This compressed file can be easily shared over the internet, allowing users with the same software to decompress and access the original file.

### 2. Decompress a File or Folder
This module facilitates the reverse process of file compression. Users can decompress a compressed file and retrieve the original file, restoring it to its original state.

### 3. View Files in the Compressed File
With this module, users can preview the contents of the compressed file. This feature allows users to inspect the files within the compressed archive before deciding to decompress them. It provides a convenient way to review and manage the contents without performing a full decompression.

### 4. Set Icon and Extension
An additional feature in the project allows users to customize the extension of the compressed file. Moreover, users have the option to specify the style of the icon associated with the compressed file. This feature adds a personal touch to the compressed files, and users can choose their preferred icon style.

## Usage:

To use the Huffman Algorithm File Compression tool, follow these steps:

1. **Compress a File or Folder:**
   - Open the application and select the "Compress" module.
   - Choose the file or folder you want to compress.
   - Click the "Compress" button to generate the compressed file.

2. **Decompress a File or Folder:**
   - Access the "Decompress" module in the application.
   - Select the compressed file you want to decompress.
   - Click the "Decompress" button to retrieve the original file.

3. **View Files in the Compressed File:**
   - Navigate to the "View" module to see the contents of a compressed file.
   - Preview the files before deciding to decompress.

4. **Set Icon and Extension:**
   - Explore the "Settings" or "Options" section to customize the icon and extension.
   - Specify the preferred extension and icon style for the compressed files.
